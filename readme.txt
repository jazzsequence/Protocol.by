== Description ==

The Protocol.by service has been sunsetted, therefore this plugin no longer works. :(

Please do not use this plugin. Ever.

================

<a href="http://protocol.by" target="_blank">Protocol.by</a> is a service developed by the MIT Media Lab to inform people what the best ways of getting in touch with you are.  This plugin allows you to use the embed code for your Protocol.by profile without having to modify any of your theme's php files.  Once installed and activated, you don't need to worry about adding the Protocol.by javascript to your header.  The only thing you need to add is `<div id="protocol"></div>` which can be done within any post or page without any theme modification whatsoever.


== Installation ==

1. Unpack the zip archive and upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the WordPress plugin installer to install.
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.
3. Once activated, you will have a Protocol.by link in your settings menu.  Click on it to go to the Protocol.by settings page.
4. Set your Protocol.by username, the width you want your embed to be (in pixels), the theme and size (options come from Protocol.by's API), and the background color (optional).
5. Save your settings and add `<div id="protocol"></div>` to any post or page on your site.
6. You're done!  Be sure you have an account with <a href="http://protocol.by" target="_blank">Protocol.by</a> before starting, of course, and that your contact information is how you want it to appear on the site from your profile page there.
